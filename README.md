Create a file called keys.py in the same directory as your main script. This file will contain your Wi-Fi credentials.

```python
WIFI_SSID = 'your_wifi_ssid'
WIFI_PASS = 'your_wifi_password'
```
Make sure to replace `'your_wifi_ssid'` and `'your_wifi_password'` with your actual Wi-Fi network credentials.
